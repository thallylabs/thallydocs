# Documentation project instructions

## Repository role

Thally has three distinct repositories. `thallylabs/thally` is the only
authored source for the open-source runtime and toolchain,
`thallylabs/starter` is this complete customer-ready template, and
`thallylabs/thally-cloud` is the private control plane.

Runtime-owned files in this repository are a generated snapshot, not a second
implementation. Never hand-apply a runtime fix here. Run the **Sync Thally
runtime** workflow, review its generated pull request, and let CI prove that
the snapshot matches the exact runtime commit in `starter-release.json`.

Before placing a feature, trace the actual creation or request path in code and
identify the deployed artifact. Do not infer ownership from repository names
or an outdated planning document.

## Project boundaries

- Pages are MDX files in `src/content/`.
- Navigation and portable product features are configured in `docs.json`.
- Site identity and versioned brand defaults live in `src/data/site.ts`.
- `starter-release.json` and runtime-owned paths listed in it are
  machine-managed; do not hand-edit them.
- Runtime changes belong in `thallylabs/thally` and arrive here only through
  the generated synchronization pull request.
- Never place credentials in source files. Use `.env.local` locally and secret
  storage in the deployment platform.

## Writing standards

- Address the reader as “you” and use active voice.
- Lead with the outcome, then state prerequisites and the shortest working path.
- Use sentence-case headings and concise paragraphs.
- Format commands, files, configuration keys, and code with backticks.
- Tell readers what success looks like and link the next useful task.
- Keep advanced or optional paths outside the primary workflow.

## Content model

- Every page needs `title` and `description` frontmatter.
- Keep page slugs stable once published.
- Add pages to `docs.json`; do not leave useful pages orphaned.
- Update `openapi.yaml` when API behavior changes.
- Run `npm ci --ignore-scripts --prefix .github/thally-tooling`, then
  `.github/thally-tooling/node_modules/.bin/thally check --ci .`, `npm test`,
  and `npm run build` before publishing.
